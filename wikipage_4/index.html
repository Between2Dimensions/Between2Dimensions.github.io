                    <span class="bold">Zane</span> is the current Elemental Master and Ninja of Ice, as well as the first Nindroid created. Zane was recruited by Master Wu, and learned Spinjitzu and discovered his other teammates, with whom he embarked on many adventures; battling the likes of the Serpentine and the Stone Army. During this time, Zane was reunited with his inventor/father figure, Dr. Julien, but sometime after the Final Battle, Dr. Julien passed away once again.

                    After Lloyd won the Final Battle, Pythor aided the Overlord in becoming the Golden Master and commanding an army Nindroids that were made from Zane's blueprints. During this time, Zane grew closer to another droid, P.I.X.A.L., and battled a Nindroid named Cryptor. The ninja clashed with the Nindroids until Zane sacrificed himself to destroy the Golden Master.

                    After building himself a new body, Zane was captured by Chen, and sent to a mysterious island. The ninja eventually found Zane in his new titanium body, (with Cole being the first) and rescued him. They then allied with the Elemental Masters to defeat the Anacondrai Cultists. With Zane back in the action, the ninja went on to battle Morro and an army of ghosts. After Nya destroyed the Cursed Realm, the ninja fought Nadakhan, who rebuilt his home realm in Ninjago, though this was undone by Jay's final wish. On the Day of the Departed, Cole accidentally revived Cryptor (and many other deceased villains), who Zane fought and destroyed once more. When the Time Twins and Vermillion warriors fought the ninja, Zane helped the ninja defeat their adversaries, but lost contact with P.I.X.A.L. in the chaos.

                    Zane later helped the ninja battle the Sons of Garmadon and started a rivalry with the elusive Nindroid, Mr. E. During the conflict, Zane discovered that P.I.X.A.L. is the new Samurai X. Together, they attempted to stop the resurrection of Lord Garmadon but ultimately failed to do so. After Garmadon conquered Ninjago, Zane was marooned in the Realm of Oni and Dragons with the original ninja and a growing Wu. They were also forced to deal with the threat of the Dragon Hunters as he, Jay, and Kai are captured and exploited for their Elemental Powers. The trio escaped with Cole and Wu, and he helped the aging Wu regain his confidence and memories. Eventually, Wu claimed the Dragon Armor and the team returns to Ninjago, where Zane reunited with his other friends in an invaded Ninjago City and defeated Garmadon's Colossus, restoring peace to Ninjago.

                    When the Oni finally invaded, Zane and the rest of the ninja fought to defend their home. Zane, the rest of the ninja, Wu, and Garmadon used the Tornado of Creation to defeat the Oni.

                    Several months later, Zane began having dreams foreshadowing an invasion of Pyro Vipers and Blizzard Samurai. The ninja accidentally released Aspheera and the Pyro Vipers shortly afterward. Zane helped the ninja fight the Pyro Vipers siege at the Monastery where he used Forbidden Spinjitzu to defeat Aspheera, only to be banished to the distant past of the Never-Realm alongside the second Scroll of Forbidden Spinjitzu. He was stranded in the unfamiliar realm, where he fell under the sway of the manipulative Vex, after having his memories erased by him. Due to Vex's manipulation, Zane overthrew Grimfax's throne and became the <span class="bold">Ice Emperor</span>, with Vex as his right-hand man, Grimfax joining them, and the Scroll corrupting his ice powers. Due to Zane being sent around 60 years into the past, he and his Blizzard Samurai ruled over the Never-Realm for long decades. His identity would finally be uncovered by Lloyd when the ninja arrived to rescue him, and Zane was able to regain his memories and return the Never-Realm to normal. After the Never-Realm was restored to its original state, Zane returned to Ninjago with his friends.

                    When citizens started vanishing in large numbers and entering Prime Empire, Zane stayed behind to prevent his memory and code from being overwritten. While in Ninjago, he began a search for Milton Dyer and eventually helped discover the secret behind Prime Empire and Unagami. Zane was used as a power source by the Mechanic to fuel the Manifestation Gate. Zane eventually escaped and fought off Unagami's invasion. Zane and P.I.X.A.L. reunited with the rest of the ninja after Jay and Dyer successfully convinced Unagami to release the formerly trapped gamers and ninja.

                    Zane later traveled to the Kingdom of Shintaro on top of Shintaro Mountain. When he discovers Cole was captured by the evil Skull Sorcerer, he travels underground and helps save him. Zane and Kai later get captured by the Geckles and tames a creature known as a Mino. Zane and Kai try to unite the Geckles and the Munce but end up being captured along with Jay, Nya, and Lloyd. The Skull Sorcerer sentences them to death, but they are saved by Plundar, a member of the Upply, under Cole's command. Zane helps the other ninja fight against the Re-Awakened and they eventually succeed. Zane, Wu, and the other ninja leave Shintaro, but prepare to go on another adventure.

                    Zane traveled to the Island of the Keepers to save Misako and Wu. He ended up being captured by the Keepers. There, the ninja discovered the Storm Amulet and the existence of Wojira. He realizes that the Keepers were being tricked into giving away sacrifices to a fake Wojira, and helped stopped the Kryptarium inmates who were behind it.

                    Later, he would explore the sea with Maya, Nya, Lloyd, P.I.X.A.L., Jay, and Benthomaar to stop Kalmaar from awakening the evil serpent, Wojira. Unfortunately, the serpent was awakened and attacked Ninjago. Zane saved as many people as possible but Wojira proved to be too powerful. Ultimately, Nya had to sacrifice herself to defeat her. Afterwards, he attended a memorial to honor Nya.

                    A year after Nya's departure, Zane turned off his emotion meter to avoid grief before learning from Nya that the only way to return her to normal is to remove her Elemental Power. Zane, along with Kai and Lloyd, eventually break Aspheera out of Kryptarium, steal her staff from the New Ninja, and return Nya back to normal before being arrested by them and sent to Kyptarium, where they learn of the Crystal King. After Nya and Dareth break them out, Zane, along with Kai and Dareth meet an amateur singer named Sally, who ran away from home. Seeing her become emotional at missing her parents, Zane managed to regain his emotions before taking her home.

                    Several weeks after the Overlord's defeat, Zane decided to search through his memory archive in order to try and recover his powers before coming face to face with his Ice Emperor self, where he forgives him and regains his powers in the process.

                    Usually seen in white clothing, Zane's Titanium form has silver hair in a tall flat-top/crew cut hairstyle with no sideburns, and sharp eyebrows. He has glowing blue eyes which are optical sensors[1] and is usually seen with straight-faced expression, reflective of his robotic nature. His cloaked form has white hair, the normal yellow skin of a LEGO character, and bright blue eyes. As of Crystalized, Zane's cloaked form now has the same blond hair color as his original body.

                <p>
                    While as the Ice Emperor, Zane's metallic skin is mostly ice blue, with a pale face-plate. This change was due to his prolonged usage of the staff containing the Forbidden Scroll that was frozen to his hand. His eyebrows were covered in frost, and he wore white samurai armor covered in ice. After regaining his memories, he discards the mask and armor, returning him to his previous appearance.

                    In "Ninjago Confidential," Zane wears a grey fedora and a light grey trench coat over his gi, dressed as a detective.

                    Having been rebuilt with titanium, Zane's skin is a shining metallic substance with lines running through his jawline and cheeks. He had a scratch on the right of his forehead, though it is gone from Tales from the Monastery of Spinjitzu onward. His eyebrows and the lines on his face somewhat changed for Tales from the Monastery, resembling his minifigure face print more (though he still lacked his minifigure's zigzagged eyebrow edges), but as of Secrets of the Forbidden Spinjitzu, his eyebrows reverted to their previous design and the lines on his face changed once again. Using some kind of cloak feature, he often switches into a more human-like form, with white hair, usually while on active ninja duty. His body under clothing is completely silver, with a chest plate on his chest depicting the pectoral muscles of the humans. On the left side of his chest he has the power source.

                    For his digital avatar image in Ninjago: Decoded and his appearance in Master of the 4th Dimension, his face has no lines on the sides and he appears to be more reflective again.

                <p>
                    Prior to Sons of Garmadon, he had a flat-top hairstyle with sideburns and no forehead scratch, as well as a light blue visor that appeared over his eyes when he wore his mask (and his parka hood in "Peak-a-Boo"). His skin became less reflective starting with The Hands of Time, possibly indicating he has worn over time.[2] However, as of Secrets of the Forbidden Spinjitzu, his skin is more reflective again, indicating this may have also been due to the animation change in The Hands of Time. Before being destroyed in his encounter with the Golden Master at the end of Rebooted, he had blond hair, normal LEGO human skin, and black eyes. At various points, half of his face would come off, revealing a more robotic look underneath. In "Darkness Shall Rise," his "skin" was portrayed as a cloth-like material, but in Rebooted, it appeared as a hard shell.

                    He had a control panel in his chest which he could open up, containing switches for vision, audio, voice, power, memory, and humor—he also had a set of switches in his arm. In Rebooted ("The Art of the Silent Fist"), his power source is found in his chest. Between Legacy of the Green Ninja qnd Rebooted his interior was upgraded.[3] It appears differently from its original design, with his power source visible and located where his heart would be and the old-fashioned switches and gears have been replaced with a more modern, wired look. The updated design was continued over to his titanium form, albeit now two-dimensional, and the power source design also appeared on his back in his first titanium design. In Sons of Garmadon ("Dead Man's Squall"), a computer scan of his body shows him having lungs.

                    From the perspective of the present, Zane was created by Dr. Julien over 40 years ago, and thus, is by far the oldest of his fellow ninja by around 20 years.[4] With the addition of around 60 years during his time in the Never-Realm's past, he is much, much older than his friends, being around a century old already.[5] Due to his robotic nature, he does not physically age, and looks brand new however old he is. He was designed to have the appearance of a young man in his late teens, but his gaining knowledge and experience can be considered the equivalent of him aging.[6]

                <p>
                    <span class="bold">Possible Estimations:</span> At the time of Skybound, his new Titanium body was said to be at most 2 years old.[7] As of the Sons of Garmadon's year time-skip, it was maybe around 3 years at most. With his additional time in the Never-Realm, his body has aged even further, due to being sent into the past and living out several decades until Vex unintentionally restores his memories and returned to Ninjago in the present day. As a result of the decades in the Never-Realm, Zane is over 100 years chronologically, his old body was around 40, and his new titanium body is around 60.
